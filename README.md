# Tone Matrix

This .dps Faust module generates a cycling tone matrix with several parameters and audio effects.

The paramaters include:
* Volume / Panning
* Cycle speed
* Base frequency
* Tone selection (sine, triangle, sawtooth)
* Scale toggling (pentatonic major, pentatonic minor, whole scale, chromatic)
* Lowpass filter cutoff frequency

The tones can then be passed through the audio effects:
* Delay
* Flanging
* Tremelo
